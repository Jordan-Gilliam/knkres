## About

### Multi-Threaded + Federated SSR

One of the biggest issues with module federation and SSR is trying to force Next.js into something that it was never designed to be. Next.js is optimized for Vercels platform. The idea is to leverage webpack to begin creating abstractions that treat [MFE, Federated Modules, Multi-Threading, Serverless, and Edge Computing] as first class citizens with 0 cloud deps.

> Huge thanks to Zack Jackson @ScriptedAlchemy - this would not be possible without his mind.
